#[
    Constants Example
    
    Constants are immutable values defined with 'con' 
    or by using Uppercase names (depending on your specific semantics).
]#

con MAX_RETRIES = 5
con VERSION = "1.0.0"

echo "Running version: #{VERSION}"

# This currently does not raise a syntax or runtime error,
# but it is discouraged to reassign constants as it returns
# nil as its not allowed.
# echo MAX_RETRIES = 10
