    Example using Dragonstone ffi to call
    methods from C, Ruby and Crystal.

# TODO: They like to print extra lines, was C now its Crystal, ffi is fucked anyways rn so fix it, and also expand feature set.

# Ruby's puts
ffi.call_ruby("puts", ["Hello from Ruby!"])

# Crystal's puts
ffi.call_crystal("puts", ["Hello from Crystal!"])

# C's printf
ffi.call_c("printf", ["Hello from C!"])
