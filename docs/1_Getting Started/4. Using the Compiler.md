## How to use the Compiler
### Using the Dragonstone for compiled programs:
Once Dragonstone is installed running files, via the compiler, is pretty straightforward and below is a guide on how. By default, the compiler is with bytecode but if you have JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Crystal, C, or LLVM (IR) toolchains installed, you can compile targets for those as well.

#### Supported Targets:
- Bytecode
- LLVM (IR)
- C
- Crystal
- Ruby
- Python
- JavaScript

---

### Build and Run Files via the Compiler with a target.
```bash
    # Supported Target Flags: bytecode, llvm, c, crystal, and ruby
    dragonstone build --target bytecode examples/hello_world.ds

    # Build and immediately execute the produced artifacts.
    dragonstone build-run --target bytecode examples/hello_world.ds
```

---

### Select Backend (for now this is a temporary flag):
```bash
    # Select between native (interpreter) or core (compiler) backends.
    dragonstone run --backend core examples/hello_world.ds

    # By default, dragonstone will use native (interpreter),
    # However, you can change it anytime.
    DRAGONSTONE_BACKEND=core dragonstone run examples/hello_world.ds

    # Or export the flag once for the CLI:
    export DRAGONSTONE_BACKEND=core
```

---

### To run files in terminals where Dragonstone has not been added to evn path (and terminals like Bash):
First change to the directory of where the dragonstone.exe is located

```bash
    ./bin/dragonstone.exe run examples/hello_world.ds
```

---

### Run Test/Spec (still building out unit tests).
```bash
    crystal spec

    # helper script that runs spec for just a specific backend.
    ./scripts/backend_ci.sh spec --backend core
```
