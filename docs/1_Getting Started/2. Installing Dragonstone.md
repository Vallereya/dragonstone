## How to install Dragonstone

### Right now the only way to install is via GitHub
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `shards build` to build the binary which gets placed in `./bin`.
3. Run `dragonstone.bat` inside `./bin` to add it to user env path and handoff to `dragonstone.ps1`.
4. If it doesn't handoff to .ps1 you can run it, or just load up your terminal and cd to ./bin
