## How to install Dragonstone

### Building from Source using Bash (All Platforms)
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change directory to this project.
3. Run `shards build` to build *(this gets placed in `./bin`)*.

### Building from Source using Terminal or Powershell (Windows Only)
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change directory to this project.
3. Run `shards build` to build *(this gets placed in `./bin`)*.
4. Run `.\bin\dragonstone.bat --rebuild-exe` *(this rebuilds the project with the `--release` flag and adds the dragonstone icon)*.
5. <font color="color:#5E06EE;">(Optional)</font> Run `.\bin\dragonstone.bat` to add `.\bin` to your users PATH environmental variable, allowing you to run `dragonstone` from anywhere. Restart your terminal after this step.

**Note**: You can also just use `shards build` on Windows for a standard build but this will not use the `--release` flag unless specified otherwise, this will make dragonstone compile/interpret usage significantly slower. <br>

**Note**: Also on Windows you can just use the installer listed in releases. <br>
