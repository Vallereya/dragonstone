## How to install Dragonstone

### *Requirements*
1. The [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) needs to be installed (*1.17.1+* but has been tested down to *1.11.2* on Ubuntu).
2. (*optional*) [**LLVM/Clang**](https://releases.llvm.org/); While [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) also installs [LLVM/Clang](https://releases.llvm.org/), installing a standalone version is recommended if you want to target `dragonstone build --target llvm` or `dragonstone build --target c`.
3. (*optional*) The [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) is needed if you want to use `dragonstone build --target ruby` (*3.4.6+*).
4. (*optional*) The [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is needed if you want to use `dragonstone build --target python` (*3.14+*).
5. (*optional*) The [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) is needed if you want to use `dragonstone build --target javascript` (*24.12.0+*).

### *To Build from Source (All Platforms)*
###### **(MacOS/Linux/Windows)**
1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` to the project directory.
3. Run `shards build --release`

<br>

> **Tip:** Always use the `--release` flag for production builds as it significantly improves performance, without it a standard build is made and the dragonstone interpreter will run files roughly about 3-5x slower.

### *To Build from Source (Linux)*
###### **(Linux Recommended)**
1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` to the project directory.
3. Run `./bin/dragonstone.sh --rebuild`
4. (optional) Run `./bin/dragonstone.sh --install` which adds `.\bin` to your user PATH.
    - After running that command please restart your terminal, then you can use `dragonstone` from anywhere.

###### **(Linux Alternative)**
3. Run `shards build --release` for a standard build and without PATH.

<br>

> **Tip for Linux Users:** If you want to rebuild the project, after already doing so, you can use `./bin/dragonstone.sh --clean` which will remove the build files, then you can use `./bin/dragonstone.sh --rebuild` to build it again. For an automated version you can use `./bin/dragonstone.sh --clean-rebuild` which will clean first then rebuild for you.

### *To Build from Source (Windows)*
###### **(Windows Recommended)**
1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` to the project directory.
3. Run `.\bin\dragonstone.bat --rebuild`
    - This builds with the icons/resources and adds `.\bin` to your user PATH.
    - After running that command please restart your terminal, then you can use `dragonstone` from anywhere.

###### **(Windows Alternative)**
3. Run `shards build --release` for a standard build, without any icons/resources or PATH.

<br>

> **Tip for Windows Users:** If you want to rebuild the project, after already doing so, you can use `.\bin\dragonstone.bat --clean` which will remove the build files, then you can use `.\bin\dragonstone.bat --rebuild` to build it again. For an automated version you can use `.\bin\dragonstone.bat --clean-rebuild` which will clean first then rebuild for you.

> **Tip for Windows Users:** An installer is also available in the [Releases](https://github.com/Vallereya/dragonstone/releases) section.
