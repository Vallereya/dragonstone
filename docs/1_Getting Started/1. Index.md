# <p align="center"> Documentation Overview

## Quick Start

In this overview we will do a deep dive into Dragonstone, the language `inspired by Ruby and Crystal but designed for programmer happiness, productivity, and choice.` You'll cover object-oriented design, testing, and data structures; essential knowledge for learning other programming languages, too!

### File Extensions of Dragonstone

It is both an interpreted and compiled, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It's file extension is `.ds`, for embedded use the file extension is `.eds`, and for the package manager these files are `.forge`. 

### For the Package Manager:
A typical dragonstone program directory will also include a TOML file, `.toml`, where you'd list important information about the program you are developing such as, name, version, authors, license, description, which version of dragonstone is needed, and other important information such as dependencies. 

## Learning Materials:

These instructions and courses help you get to know the language and how to use it.
