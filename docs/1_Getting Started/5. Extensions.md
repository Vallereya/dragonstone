#### If you use the Code Runner extension in VSCode:
- Go to VSCode extensions folder (will look something like "formulahendry.code-runner-0.12.2")
- Find Code Runner
- Open package.json
- add "dragonstone": "dragonstone run" around like 190 under "code-runner.executorMap"
- add "dragonstone": "dragonstone run" around like 235 under "code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension"
