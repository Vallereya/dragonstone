### Variables:

To store a value and re-use it later, it can be assigned to a variable. For example, if you want to say Hello! three times, you don't need to repeat the same string multiple times. Instead, you can assign it to a variable and re-use it:

    1   message = "Hello!"
    2   puts message
    3   puts message
    4   puts message
    5   

This program prints the string Hello! three times to the standard output, each followed by a line break. The name of a variable always starts with a lowercase Unicode letter (or an underscore) and can otherwise consist of alphanumeric characters or underscores. As a typical convention, upper-case letters are avoided and names are written in snake_case.

`The kind of variables is called local variables. Other kinds will be introduced later.`

#### Type:

The type of a variable is automatically inferred by the interpreter. In the above example, it's String. You can verify this with typeof:

    1   message = "Hello Jules!"
    2   
    3   p! typeof(message)
    4   

`p! is similar to puts as it prints the value to the standard output, but it also prints the expression in code. It's a useful tool for inspecting its state and debugging.`

### Reassigning a Value:

A variable can be reassigned with a different value:

    1   message = "Hello Jules!"
    2   
    3   p! message
    4   
    5   message = "Hello Ringo!"
    6   
    7   p! message
    8   

This also works with values of different types. The type of the variable changes when a value of a different type is assigned. The interpreter is smart enough to know which type it has at which point in the program.

    1   message = "Hello Jules!"
    2   
    3   p! message, typeof(message)
    4   
    5   message = 73
    6   
    7   p! message, typeof(message)
    8
