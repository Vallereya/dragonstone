## A Dragonstone Program
A program is all the source code the interpreter or compiler works on. The source code is first parsed, and then it is either run directly by the interpreter or turned by the compiler into an executable version of the program.

The source code of a program must be encoded in UTF-8, as this is the default used for Dragonstone.

### Top-Level Scope
Things like types, constants, macros, and methods that are not defined inside any namespace belong to the top-level scope. This means they are defined at the outermost level of the program, not inside another module or namespace:

    1   # defines a method for the top-level scope.
    2   def add(x, y)
    3       x + y
    4   end
    5   
    6   # invokes that add method, and prints.
    7   echo add(5, 10)
    8   

    OUTPUT: 15

Local variables defined at the top level of a file can only be used in that file. They are still visible inside method bodies, so methods can still read or change them directly:

    1   x = 1
    2   
    3   def add(y)
    4       x + y
    5   end
    6   
    7   echo add(2)
    8   

    OUTPUT: 3

### Main Scope
Any code that is not part of a method, constant, or type definition, etc. and not inside a body, is treated as main code. Main code runs automatically when the program starts, in the same order as the source files are included.

There is no need to use any special entry point to a main scope, such as a main method:

    1   # This is a program that prints "Hello!"
    2   echo "Hello!"
    3   

    OUTPUT: Hello!

A main scope can also be inside namespaces:

    1   class Hello
    2       echo self
    3   end
    4   

    OUTPUT: Hello
