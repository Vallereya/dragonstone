## About Specification
This section will give a formal specification of Dragonstone.

It's in a order that attempts to go from easy -> hard, in terms of difficulty of the concept. But, some concepts may have to be referenced to other pages within this specification.

It is recommended that you read `Introduction` first, especially if you are new to programming, as some topics are discussed there as well.

In some of the code examples, you might find a comment which will be starting with `#` and will show additional information.

Example:

    1   # This is a comment.
    2   echo "hello"    # This is a trailing comment.
    3
