## Numbers:
Now, Dragonstone quite a few ways to deal with Data, for our introduction we're going to work on numbers. There are 2 ways to deal with numbers: `int (Integer)` and `float (Float)`. 

    1   e! typeof(1)
    2   e! typeof(1.5)
    3   

    OUTPUT: typeof(1) # => "Int"
            typeof(1.5) # => "Float"

Float values print with a decimal point whereas Integer values don't.

### Arithmetic
#### Equality and Comparison
If two numbers have the same value, the `==` operator says they are equal, no matter what type they are.

    1   e! 1 == 1
    2   e! 1 == 2
    3   e! 1.5 == 1
    4   e! -2.0 == -2
    5   

    OUTPUT: 1 == 1 # => true
            1 == 2 # => false
            1.5 == 1 # => false
            -2.0 == -2 # => true

In addition to the equality operator, there are comparison operators that check how two values relate to each other. Like equality, comparisons work the same way no matter the type.

    1   e! 2 > 1
    2   e! 1 >= 1
    3   e! 1 < 2
    4   e! 1 <= 2
    5   

    OUTPUT: 2 > 1 # => true
            1 >= 1 # => true
            1 < 2 # => true
            1 <= 2 # => true

The `<=>` operator, called the spaceship operator because of how it looks, compares two values. It returns 0 if they are equal, a positive number if the first is larger, or a negative number if the second is larger. It acts like all the other comparison operators combined.

    1   e! 1 <=> 1
    2   e! 2 <=> 1
    3   e! 1 <=> 2
    4   e! 5.5 <=> 5
    5   

    OUTPUT: 1 <=> 1 # => 0
            2 <=> 1 # => 1
            1 <=> 2 # => -1
            5.5 <=> 5 # => 1

#### Operators
You can do basic math using operators. Most of them take two values and are written between those values, like `a + b`. Some only need one value and are written before it, like `-a`. The expression’s value is the result of that operation.

    1   e! 1 + 1    # addition
    2   e! 1 - 1    # subtraction
    3   e! 2 * 3    # multiplication
    4   e! 2 ** 4   # exponentiation
    5   e! 6 / 2    # division
    6   e! 2 // 3   # floor division
    7   e! 7 % 3    # modulus
    8   e! -1       # negation
    9   e! +1       # unary plus
    10  

    OUTPUT: 1 + 1 # => 2
            1 - 1 # => 0
            2 * 3 # => 6
            2 ** 4 # => 16.0
            6 / 2 # => 3.0
            2 // 3 # => 0
            7 % 3 # => 1
            -1 # => -1
            +1 # => 1

Most math operations with integers give another integer as the result. The division operator `/` is an exception because it always gives a float. The floor division operator `//` gives an integer result, but rounded down to the nearest whole number. When you mix integers and floats in an operation, the result is always a float. In other cases, the result usually has the same type as the first value.

Here's a full list of the support operators in Dragonstone:

```

#### Precedence
When an expression uses several operators, the question is which one is applied first. In math, for example, multiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction, and Dragonstone follows the same precedence rules for its operators.

    1   e! 7 + 5 * 3
    2   e! (3 + 4) * 2
    3   

    OUTPUT: 7 + 5 * 3 # => 22
            3 + 4 * 2 # => 14

Here's a full list of the operator precedence:

```
    Unary 	                            +, &+, -, &-, !, ~
    Exponential 	                    **, &**
    Multiplicative 	                    *, &*, /, //, %
    Additive 	                        +, &+, -, &-
    Shift 	                            <<, >>
    Binary AND 	                        &
    Binary OR/XOR 	                    |,^
    Equality and Subsumption 	        ==, !=, ===
    Comparison 	                        <, <=, >, >=, <=>
    Logical AND 	                    &&
    Logical OR 	                        ||
    Range 	                            .., ...
    Assignment 	                        =, []=, +=, &+=, -=, &-=,
                                        *=, &*=, /=, //=, %=, |=,
                                        &=,^=,**=,<<=,>>=, ||=, &&=
