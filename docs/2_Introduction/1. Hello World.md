### Hello World:

The first thing you need to learn in any programming language is the famous Hello World! program. In Dragonstone this is pretty simple:

    1   puts "Hello World!"
    2 

The entire program consists of a call to the method `puts` with the string `Hello World!` as an argument. This method prints the string to the standard output. All code in the top-level scope is part of the main program. In this example there is no explicit main function as entry point to the program needed.
