## Hello World:
The first thing you need to learn in any programming language is normally Hello World! program. In Dragonstone this is pretty simple:

    1   echo "Hello World!"
    2 

    OUTPUT: Hello World!
    
The entire program consists of a call to the method `echo` with the string `Hello World!` as an argument. This method prints the string to the standard output. All code in the top-level scope is part of the main program, so in this example there is no need for an explicit main function as the entry point to the program. These kinds of variables are called `local variables`.
