# Self-Hosting/Bootstrapping Directory
This is a working directory for Self-Hosting/Bootstrapping, currently ignored files, but will be unignored when complete.

> WARNING: The self-hosted/bootstrapped dragonstone is a work in progress, it does not work as intended right now and some files are just the `stage0` crystal implementation copy/paste so I can view them in one spot. Also these files are not a good representation of "good" dragonstone code as they were implemented in steps based on what was available at the time during the bootstrap phase.
