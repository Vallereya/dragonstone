    `Colorize` Module is for colorizing text output in the terminal. It
    adds ANSI escape codes to strings to change their color and style when 
    printed to a terminal that supports ANSI codes.

    This is inspired by similar libraries, `Colorize` and `Paint` gems in
    Ruby, `rainbow` in Node.js, `Colorize` stdlib from Crystal, and 
    `colorama` in Python, among others, and adapted for Dragonstone.
