    Annotations Example

    !# This currently does not work.

    I have the infrastructure for annotations
    (parsing and semantic storage) fully
    implemented, but no application for 
    using them for anything other than the 
    Garbage Collection flags at the moment.
    I will soon allow you to define and read 
    custom annotations. Currently, Dragonstone 
    does store these annotations. The runtime
    doesn't fully act on them yet.

# Example One
# @[Deprecated(message: "Use new_method instead")]
# def old_method
#     echo "This is old."
# end

# old_method

# Example Two
# @[Author(name: "V", version: "1.0")]
# class Calculator
    
#     @[Deprecated(message: "Use add instead")]
#     def sum(a, b)
#         return a + b
#     end

#     def add(a, b)
#         return a + b
#     end
# end
