    I dump junk here to do quick tests for 
    dragonstone or to explore things I might
    integrate. 
    
    If you happen to come across something in 
    here, there's a 99% chance it's not going 
    to work.

    Because it is either not working, code 
    snippets that I might get integrate
    or just junk in general.
