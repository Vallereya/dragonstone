# This is the dragonstone benchmark testing file.

#[ 
    In here is a testing benchmark file I've
    been using to make sure new implementations,
    updates or changes don't drastically slow
    down the language.

    Tested on 04-11-2025:
        Iterations Tested of 1,000,000 (1 Million)
        5 Passes with an Average of 242-246ms.

        If we were going to 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion),
        this would take about ~4 Minutes.

while i > 0
    s = s + i
