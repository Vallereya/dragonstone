## What is Dragonstone?
Well it's a suppose to be an interpreted ruby-like programming language built with ruby (yeeted all of it due to performance), crystal (mostly) and c (some) but I don't know what I'm doing and it's my first time making a language. Sorry if some files don't make sense this is my v4 of this after all, thank you.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for sample `.ds` files.

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `shards build` to build the binary which gets placed in `./bin`.
3. Run `dragonstone.bat` inside `./bin` to add it to env path and handoff to `dragonstone.ps1`.

## Usage

### Run Files

```bash
    dragonstone run examples/hello_world.ds

    ./bin/dragonstone.exe run examples/hello_world.ds
```

### Run Tests
```bash
    crystal spec
```
